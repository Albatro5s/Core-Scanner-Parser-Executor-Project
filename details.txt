Description:
Tokenizer.java takes in an input data file and - in a do-while 
loop - reads in the next token using the nextToken method (same
as skipToken), reading past whitespaces until it registers a non
EOF token. It reads in characters one at a time to determine if
it's a 1, 2, or more char token using a switch case.
Using the token it reads, it assigns it an int identifier, the 
type of token, and stores the original string of the token read
from the input file. (all of these are retreivable using
getToken, intVal, and idName).

Testing:
Tested the program using the provided test data samples and
modified versions of the code for different cases.

Known Issues:
There's only one bug I'm aware of currently:
    - Everything processes fine with the exception of when there
    are single char variables/identifiers followed by an end 
    token or special character, specifically parenthesis or 
    brackets. 
    If whitespace is between the tokens or the id is 2 chars 
    long, there's no issue.
